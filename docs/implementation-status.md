- Day 6-10: Portal dashboard UI and routing
- Day 11-14: Firebase custom claims and middleware

### **Phase 3: Document Management (Weeks 5-6)**
- Day 1-7: Document upload/download with Firebase Storage
- Day 8-10: Document management UI components  
- Day 11-14: Security testing and access controls

## **Success Criteria**

### **M2 Payment System Success:**
- Attorney can generate payment links from dashboard
- Clients can complete Stripe checkout successfully  
- Payment success automatically updates client status to "retained"
- Portal creation triggers automatically after payment

### **M3 Portal System Success:**
- Clients can access personalized portals with unique URLs
- Document upload/download works securely
- Portal authentication prevents unauthorized access
- Attorney can manage client documents through admin interface

---

## **Risk Mitigation**

### **Stripe Integration Risks:**
- **Webhook reliability:** Implement retry logic and manual reconciliation
- **Payment security:** Use Stripe's secure checkout, never handle card data
- **Status sync:** Ensure payment success reliably updates client status

### **Portal Security Risks:**
- **Access control:** Implement proper UUID validation and custom claims
- **Document security:** Ensure Firebase Storage rules prevent cross-client access
- **Authentication:** Separate client auth from attorney auth completely

### **Performance Risks:**
- **Document storage:** Monitor Firebase Storage quotas and costs
- **Portal scaling:** Design for 1,000 portal limit with efficient queries
- **Concurrent users:** Test 25 concurrent user limit under load

---

## **Current Blockers**

### **None for Phase 1 (Stripe)**
- Backend infrastructure complete and tested
- Admin dashboard ready for payment button integration
- Configuration system ready for Stripe credentials

### **Dependencies for Phase 2 (Portal)**
- Requires Stripe integration completion (automatic portal creation)
- Client custom claims system needs design
- Document management UI needs mockups/design

**Ready to begin Stripe integration immediately.**
